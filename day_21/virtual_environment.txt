1. To create a new virtual environment
 -> python -m venv env

2. To activate venv
i. For Linux/Mac
    source venv/bin/activate
ii. For Windows
    -> cd venv

The above works on command promts but not in powershell
(bahira niskina cd .. cd ..)

3. pip install <package_name> #This installs the package from pypi
4. pip list -> this list all the packages in the virtual environment
5. pip freeze -> this also lists the pacakges
6. pip freeze requirements.txt -> this lists all the package in the requirements.txt file
7. pip install -r requirements.txt -> this recursively installs packages from the requirements.txt file
8. pip uninstall <package_name>
9. deactivate -> it will deactivate the virtual environment
